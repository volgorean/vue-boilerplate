# vue-boilerplate

> A Simple vue template for quick prototyping based on [webpack-simple](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack) but with router, store, aliases, and structure included. I've also made some minor modifications to the webpack config and npm commands to help with some common pitfalls.

### Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init volgorean/vue-boilerplate my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
